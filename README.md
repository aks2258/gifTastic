# gifTastic

A GIPHY generator that uses the GIPHY API to display gifs related to the already existing two buttons. 

User can input new gif buttons of their own, or related to the app theme (Funny Stuff), in the input field to the right of the page.

When the user submits the input, a button is created at the end of the previous line of buttons. If the user clicks their created button, or any of the other 2 previously created buttons, Still Gifs are generated in a single line column. In order to animate them, simply click on the Gif. To put them back into still form, click on the gif again.
